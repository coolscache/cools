summary: In response to a struggle of mine (the inability to remember cool shit in books I've read); Nerdy Nuggies was created to provide reading repetition and a place to look back on all the cool points I've read. 

challenge-title: the challenge
the-challenge: My idea was — read the book, note the good bits, go back to the good bits and create a blog post on my blog. But first I had to break my backend coding virginity and create said blog. The ultimate challange became finding a coding language that 
c-point1: allowed me to create a database to add content as I go
c-point2: made predominant use of HTML and CSS
c-point3: was (relatively) easy to understand 

learning-process-title: learning process
learning1: Naturally I began by with Wordpress, trialling Elementor, and attempting to customise my theme through PHP. However, I grew distaste for a large limitation of Wordpress — plugins. Next came Gatsby, but I'd never touched node.js and was a bit overwhelmed. I went through this cycle at least twice before I came across the Holy Grail — Superhi. I had finally found a tutorial (and a reasonably straighforward programming language) that seemed do-able.

learning2: From Superhi's recommendations, I used Siteleaf as my content management system, and hosted via github pages. The course, Jekyll docs, and endless stackoverflow threads produced Nerdy Nuggies. I broke my backend coding virginity and produced a website I'm (just a little) proud of. 

lessons-learnt-title: what I learnt
lessons-learnt: I learnt so much throughout this entire process as I really wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn how to create a fully functional website. I would love to learn how to create a search bar — and did attempt to do this but struggled with the jekyll docs. I will also work on implementing a better url address in the future.
